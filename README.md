Iris DNN Classifier

This project implements a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier using TensorFlow and Keras to classify the Iris dataset. The model is trained on features such as Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width to predict the species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).

The model achieves a test accuracy of 96.67%.

Key Features:

Model Architecture: A DNN with 3 hidden layers using ReLU activation.
Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy.
Optimizer: Adam.
Evaluation: The model was evaluated on a separate test dataset, achieving a test accuracy of 96.67%.
